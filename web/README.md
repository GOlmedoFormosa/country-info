# Anyfin Full Stack Challenge

## Requirements

Create a simple web interface for your NodeJs server using React.js which allows users to:

1. Search and add countries to a list displaying the full country name, population and currency (be mindful of no of requests you make to server)
2. Enter an amount in SEK and get the amount converted into local currency next to each country in the list. Feel free to use any npm packages you like as long as they're OSS, but you need to be able to motivate your choices and we value concise, well structured code with a small footprint.

## Technologies Used

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installing/Running locally

- Make sure you have `Yarn` installed.
- Run

  ```bash
    - git clone https://github.com/GOlmedoFormosa/country-info-web.git
    - cd country-info-web
    - yarn install
  ```

- Create/configure `.env` environment with your credentials. A sample `.env.example` file has been provided to get you started. Make a duplicate of `.env.example` and rename to `.env`, then configure your credentials.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
